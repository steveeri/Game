Synopsis

The project consist of an arcade styled helicopter flying game using android app developed written in Kotlin.

The game is a an atypical arcade scrolling game, with touch controls from the user to try to keep in flight avoiding missiles and sky and ground barriers. 


Code Example

Code is based on Android API level 28, using Android-Studio 3.0.1.  The core code is Kotlin 1.2 stable.
THe structure of the project files is consistent with what you would expect from Android Studio.

The sprite images, codebase are based on a learning package downloaded from the internet - from an open source site/sites - that I can no longer remember, so I cannot cite them. e bad :(


Motivation

I started this project primariliy to develop awareness of graphic APIs, game play concepts, and and animation.


Installation

This package consists of all source code as well as a compiled and signed apk (if you want to install and try).  


API Reference

THe graphics library used is the core Android sufaceView canvas - no other third party software included oustide of


Tests

TODO - me bad again.


Contributors

If anyone wants to assist with improving the game for use on tablets and newer devices.  It is largely complete and functional from my perspective, and the purposes of which the project was created.  

Would be interesting to see how to duplicate this game on iOS using Swift!
